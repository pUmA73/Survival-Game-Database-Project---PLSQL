# Survival Game Database Project - PL/SQL

This database management project is crafted for a survival game, focusing on the storage and management of essential game data to enrich the gameplay experience. It caters to various aspects of the game, including:

- **Resources**: Manages crucial resources like water, food, materials, and medical items, ensuring players have everything they need to survive.
- **Environmental Settings**: Keeps track of biomes, weather conditions, flora, and more, adding depth to the game's world.
- **Player Character Details**: Stores details about the player's character such as inventory, health, hunger, thirst, and body temperature.
- **Multiplayer Tables**: Uses tables for multiplayer features - tracking players on a server, player usernames, inventories, and locations.

The project includes SQL scripts for establishing the database schema, featuring tables for biomes, weather conditions, NPCs (Non-Playable Characters), and player statistics. Furthermore, it incorporates procedures and triggers to execute game-specific logic, enhancing the interactivity and functionality of the survival game.
This project was developed for the Data Base Management Systems course.
